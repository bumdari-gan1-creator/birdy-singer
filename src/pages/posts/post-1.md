## Australian Tour Begins in Brisbane

Birdy’s first major Australian tour kicked off at The Tivoli in Brisbane on 3 April 2013. The run of dates was presented by Live Nation and followed the huge local success of her self-titled debut album and her multi-platinum cover of “Skinny Love.” 
Starting in a classic theatre-style venue like The Tivoli set the tone for the whole tour: seated but intimate rooms where her piano-driven songs and delicate vocals could really be heard. Fans at these early shows were among the first in Australia to hear a mix of album favourites alongside soundtrack songs such as “Just a Game.” 

After Brisbane, the tour moved west to Perth and then across the country, but that opening night was important in proving she could carry a full headline set so far from home. It also helped confirm Australia as one of Birdy’s strongest overseas markets, something reflected in her ARIA chart success and repeated returns to play theatres in later years.
