## A Standout Night in Cleveland
 
On 24 April 2014, concert listings show a performance titled “Birdy – House of Blues Cleveland,” considered one of the standout nights of her US spring run. By this time Birdy was already performing songs from Fire Within around the world, and fans recall that in the intimate club setting of Cleveland her folk-pop songs and quiet piano ballads felt even closer and more personal.

Club shows in cities like Cleveland played an important role in helping Birdy build a loyal fanbase in the US music market. When she later returned to North America with her own Beautiful Lies Tour, performing in larger theatres and at festivals, these earlier club nights were remembered as her “first steps,” and the experience she gained on the 2013–2014 tours became the main foundation for developing her live style into something more cinematic and dramatic.
