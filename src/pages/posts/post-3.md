## Joining the Head or Heart Tour in Orlando
 
In the spring of 2014, Birdy joined Christina Perri’s Head or Heart Tour in the United States as the opening act, travelling through small theatres and clubs across the country. The House of Blues concert in Orlando took place on 2 May 2014 and is listed as one of the official dates on Perri’s Head or Heart tour schedule. There, Birdy played a short but striking set featuring her Fire Within songs like “Wings” and “Words as Weapons,” alongside earlier hits such as “Skinny Love,” gently easing the audience into a calm, reflective mood before the main show began.

### What happened after this

Throughout the Head or Heart Tour she performed a similar set in comparable nightclubs and theatres in cities like Atlanta, Houston, Dallas, San Francisco and Seattle, which helped introduce her to a much wider American audience. Even though she was a support or opening artist on this run, reviewers described Birdy’s set as quietly beginning but reaching a powerful, emotional climax by the end. Many see this experience as something that helped her step confidently into larger-scale headline tours for her own album Beautiful Lies (2016).
